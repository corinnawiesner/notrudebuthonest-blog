Ruby on Rails has become a well accepted and highly appreciated tool for building modern web apps. A complete and well cultivated eco system has been created over the years. Now the increasing demand for mobile applications raises a demand for well designed (JSON) APIs to talk to. It is not less than a perfect match. Ruby on Rails is so sweet to build both web apps as well as APIs to be consumed by mobile apps. In this talk you will have a look at common challenges such as authentication, designing the API’s JSON structures as well as how to minimize traffic between your mobile app and its backend. Exemplary ways to encounter those challenges will be illustrated on both sides: the rails server and the mobile app. At the end of this talk you will have a basic plan on how to approach a mobile app using Ruby on Rails and how build its backend, easily.
