Last week, I was able to attend Euruko 2012 in Amsterdam with a few of my colleagues from [Avarteq](http://www.avarteq.de/){:target="_blank"} . We arrived thursday night, hence we missed the boat party at thursday night.

The conference was held in the Pathé Tuschinski. Pathé Tuschinski is a beautiful movie theatre. Nearly 600 attendees occupied the theatre, quite amazing, as the [“Happy Friday Hug”](https://twitter.com/hone02/status/208491286217490434/photo/1/large){:target="_blank"}  depicts.

My favorite talk at the conference was “JRuby, dudes!” by Charles Nutter. He successfully gave an in-depth presentation of JRuby with practical examples. I also liked the beginner friendly talk “Ruby’s big men” by Elise Huard. Elise [described in a simple manner](https://speakerdeck.com/u/elise_huard/p/rubys-bin-men){:target="_blank"}  the garbage collector in Ruby and its various implementations. As an iOS developer I also enjoyed Eloy Duran with his talk about [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/){:target="_blank"} .

The obligatory parties friday at [Club Home](http://clubhome.nl/){:target="_blank"}  and saturday at [Roest](http://amsterdamroest.nl/){:target="_blank"}  completed the overall good impressions from Euruko 2012. Hopefully, I can attend Euruko in Greek next year.
